    ### PREFACE 

        NodeJS is a bit innovation that shits the paradigm in web development

        NodeJS applications are written in JavaScript (the language of the web) 
        so we can have a single application stack (share code between server and 
        client). This also opens back-end possibilities for front-end engineers.

        NodeJS contributes to the evolution of JavaScript as people realize they 
        can use the language on the server. They also love its flexibility, 
        pragmatism, event driven approach and hybrid nature (being in between 
        OOP and functional).

        NodeJS' single-threaded model and its asynchronous architecture beside 
        advantages such as scalability and performance changed the way we approach
        concurrency and parallelism. Mutexes are replaced by queues, threads by 
        callbacks and synchronization by causality.

        The last important aspect of Node.js lies in its package manager.

        Node.js is different compared to other server-sie platforms. Although at 
        first the way we can configure and structure our code seems confusing, but
        the platform is now sufficiently mature to implement its own module system.

        THIS BOOK COVERS:

        The "Node way" 

            How to approach Node.js development, how traditional design 
            patterns look in Node.js

        
        Node.js patterns

            A set of patterns to solve common Node.js design and coding problems:


        How to write scalable and efficient Node.js applications:

            Understanding the building blocks and principles of writing large 
            and well-organized Node.js applications that can scale.
            
        
        Code in "modern JavaScript":

            JavaScript appeared in 1995 but it has evolved massively, this book 
            uses its modern features. Throughout the book we will also see 
            real-life libraries and technologies (which will be used to
            demonstrate a pattern or technique).
