    ### CHAPTER 1: The Node.js Platform

        Some principles define the developer experience. For Node.js its most peculiar
        aspect is its asynchronous nature, which makes use of callbacks and promises.

        Another important aspect of Node.js is its philosofy. It has its own culture and 
        community and this influences how applications are created


        The Node.js philosophy

            All platforms have their own principles and guidelines. Some of these principles 
            arise from the technology itself, some are enabled by the ecosystem and some are
            trends in the community, while others are borrowed from other platforms.In Node.js
            some of these principles come directly from its creator Ryan Dahl, while others come 
            from the people who controbute to the core.

       
        Small core

            The Node.js core (the runtime and built in module) follows the principle of having the 
            smallest set of functionalities, while the rest of the modules in the ecosystem live outside
            the core. This allows the community to experiment and iterate faster, while also being
            easely maintainable.


        Small modules

            Node.js uses modules as the fundamental building block for creating applications
            while structuring code to be reusable. This principle has its roots in the Unix 
            philosophy, and particularly in two of its precepts:
"Small is beautiful."
"Make each program do one thing well."

        Node.js uses the concept of a module as the fundamental means for structuring the
code of a program. It is the building block for creating applications and reusable
libraries. In Node.js, one of the most evangelized principles is designing small
modules (and packa
